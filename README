Write a utility

  % ./fiend [-P | -L]* FILENAME* EXPRESSION

that does depth-first traversals of the directory tree(s) rooted at the        |
FILENAME(s) specified in the left-to-right order that they appear in the       |
command line.  For each file in each tree, it evaluates the EXPRESSION         |
specified from left to right, according to the rules of precedence, until the  |
outcome is known (the left-hand side of an AND operation is false or the       |
left-hand side of an OR operation is true).                                    |
 
fiend (pronounced fie-end) is a stripped down version of the Linux utility find
that implements only the subset of command-line arguments containing:

* the "real" options -P and -L;
 
* the expression components -depth, -exec, -maxdepth, -name, -newer, -print;
 
* the operators -o and -a.
 
Except as noted below, fiend matches the behavior of /bin/find
